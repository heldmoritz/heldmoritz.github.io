We present a multitasking model that performs a driving task in different driving conditions while performing a secondary working memory task. We developed two models\\ One that implements a central bottleneck at the central processing unit and a second model that additionally implements a bottleneck in the problem state of ACT-R. We compare the behavior of both models with human data in different driving and workload conditions. On top of different driving conditions, we show predictions of the model when working memory load is manipulated using a secondary task. By evaluating the behavior of the model, we conclude that a central bottleneck is insufficient when attempting to explain the interaction of cognitive load and driving difficulty. Instead, a bottleneck in the problem state can account for the differences in driving behavior between driving conditions and between working memory load levels.","tags":[],"title":"Multitasking while Driving: Central Bottleneck or Problem State Interference?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Moritz Held"],"categories":null,"content":"You can expect my first blog post here, if I am not too shy to post it.\n","date":1638230400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638230400,"objectID":"de0e7df0f9c7425179d8c23b50ff4d36","permalink":"https://heldmoritz.github.io/blog/post1/","publishdate":"2021-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/post1/","section":"blog","summary":"Attaining a PhD can be an exhausting and grueling task.

A key step in this approach is the accurate prediction of momentary cognitive workload while driving. Previous research has found an interaction between working memory load and visuospatial attention complicating the accurate predicition for these cognitive concepts. We have developed an ACT-R model to investigate the nature of the interaction and improve the prediction accuracy for working memory load and visuospatial attention while driving. This ACT-R model is driving on a multi-lane highway with concurring traffic and alternating lane-widths while doing a secondary n-back task using speed signs. Furthermore, it is able to handle complex driving situations like overtaking traffic and adjusting its speed according to the n-back task. The behavioral results show an increase in error rates in the secondary task with increasing n-back difficulty as well as a decrease in driving performance with increasing difficulty in the n-back task. The results of the model indicate an interaction at a common task-unspecific level.","tags":[],"title":"Utilizing ACT-R to investigate interactions between working memory and visuospatial attention while driving","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1607817600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607817600,"objectID":"877b06d200d50402f644484d45424fbc","permalink":"https://heldmoritz.github.io/projects/models/model1/","publishdate":"2020-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/models/model1/","section":"projects","summary":"Implements an n-back model into the driving model as well as an adaptation to the driving model itself.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"N-back while driving","type":"projects"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Project Description This work was motivated by the findings of Jakob Scheunemann, Anirudh Unni and Jochem Rieger, who found interactions between two cognitive concepts while driving. These interactions have been attributed to a central bottleneck or to the so-called problem-state bottleneck, related to working memory usage. We developed two different cognitive models in the cognitive architecture ACT-R, which implement the two different bottlenecks. The models performed a highway driving task, during which we varied visuospatial attention and working memory load. To evaluate the models, we conducted an experiment with human participants and compared the behavioral data to the model’s behavior.\nLink to the paper ","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606780800,"objectID":"4fe19f4877df9244e9d1213738040001","permalink":"https://heldmoritz.github.io/projects/wmldriving/","publishdate":"2020-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/wmldriving/","section":"projects","summary":"This project involved building two complex driving models implementing two different bottlenecks in cognitive processing.
