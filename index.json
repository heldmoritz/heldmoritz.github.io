However, some researchers continue to challenge this conviction in an argument for adaptive automation (Hancock et al., 2013).\rIn the context of driving, man-machine systems implementing adaptive automation are envisioned to continuously engage the driver in the driving task and at the same time, dynamically adapt the task-load depending on the driver’s momentary cognitive ability. A key step towards this approach is to continuously monitor the driver’s mental state and predict when the automation system should take more responsibilities and when to give them back to prevent drivers from mentally disengaging in the driving task.\rPredicting mental workload has been done in recent studies using neuroimaging data (e.g., fNIRS; Unni et al., 2017; Scheunemann et al., 2019) but has come with limitations as different types of cognitive workload were interacting instead of adding at the brain level, which led to a decrease in prediction accuracy for two cognitive concepts relevant to driving: working memory load and visuospatial attention. In this project, we developed a cognitive model in the cognitive architecture ACT-R that integrates these two cognitive concepts to provide insights into how, when and where they interact.\n\r","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606780800,"objectID":"4fe19f4877df9244e9d1213738040001","permalink":"https://heldmoritz.github.io/projects/wmldriving/","publishdate":"2020-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/wmldriving/","section":"projects","summary":"Implementing a complex driving environment into ACT-R","tags":["Adaptive Automation"],"title":"Modeling working memory load while driving","type":"projects"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
