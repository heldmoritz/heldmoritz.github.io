Although cognitive load associated with secondary tasks tends to affect driving negatively, a simple secondary task can improve driving performance when the driving scenario is mundane. Nijboer and colleagues (2016) have hypothesized that if the driving task is simple, people might start mind-wandering, which interferes with driving. Furthermore, the authors proposed that a simple secondary task, which imposes less workload than mind-wandering, could prevent this from happening and thereby improve driving performance. Automation systems that are informed about and adapt to the cognitive state of the driver could leverage this effect by inducing mild cognitive load during mundane driving scenarios. To test suitable interventions, we combined an existing driver model with an existing model of mind-wandering implemented in the cognitive architecture ACT-R as executable theories of mind-wandering and cognitive processing in driving. Using these different models we show how mind-wandering harms driving performance at the behavioral level and that interventions eliciting mild cognitive load can mitigate this behavioral effect. However, the model indicates that some interventions incur a significant cognitive processing cost that adaptive automation systems must account for.\n","date":1688860800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688860800,"objectID":"9a0e11725659febc85118e2f659ea3cc","permalink":"https://heldmoritz.github.io/projects/held-mindwandering-2023/held-mindwandering-2023/","publishdate":"2023-07-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/held-mindwandering-2023/held-mindwandering-2023/","section":"projects","summary":"In this study, we make predictions on the effects of different interventions by adaptive automation systems designed to prevent mind-wandering while driving.

Several theories assume that human drivers’ evaluation of the criticality of a dynamic traﬀic situation is mostly determined by the time-to-collision (TTC). We are developing a cognitive model using ACT-R to shed light on the complex cognitive processes that underlie situation awareness in a highly dynamic traﬀic scenario, in order to determine how participants evaluate the different conditions as critical or not. Our model aims to replicate empirical data from a video-study in which participants watched a potentially risky lane-change scenario and were instructed to rate how critical the situation was, and to select which action they would prefer to choose at the end of the scenario (i.e., accelerating, decelerating, maintaining speed; Stoll et al., 2018). The model observes the scenario and establishes a projection (about another road user’s position, trajectory, etc). As the driving scenario develops, the model checks whether the current projection is still valid, and in case it is not, a new memory retrieval takes place to adjust situation awareness. Importantly, according to our reasoning, drivers’ criticality evaluation is not a result of mere TTC perception, but of memory retrieval of past scenarios that help drivers to interpret the situation and make projections about its outcome. Moreover, we argue that other relevant road users and their situation (e.g., goal and intention) are taken into account during the criticality estimation process. With other words, we suggest that the driver’s situation awareness includes the representation of other road users’ situation awareness as well, to a certain extent.","tags":[],"title":"Challenges in modeling situation awareness and criticality estimation in driving based on a video-study: An ACT-R model","type":"archive"},{"authors":["Moritz Held","Jelmer Borst","Anirudh Unni","Jochem W.

Next to developments towards full automation, a separate field is making great contributions towards dynamically sharing the responsibilities between machine and human. For a successful implementation of this technology, a key step is to understand the cognitive processes in high workload situations while driving. For example, to reliably predict momentary cognitive workload and task interference. Following this line of research, cognitive models can greatly improve our understanding of the cognitive mechanisms relevant for complex driving scenarios. To this end, we have further developed a cognitive driving model in the cognitive architecture ACT-R. This model simulated behavior and brain data of a dataset in which working memory load and visuospatial demands were manipulated using a modified n-back task and alternating road conditions in a highway driving environment. In this talk, we will highlight the diﬀiculties that arise when specifying and parameterizing highly dynamic models and how we can use data from neuroimaging research as well as behavioral data to guide the model’s development. We discuss steps of optimizing this process and show how such driving models when properly calibrated can give insight into cognitive processes and how they can be used to make predictions about behavior and neurophysiology in driving related scenarios.","tags":[],"title":"Dealing with highly dynamic models: How behavioral and neuroimaging data can guide the modeling process in applied driving models","type":"archive"},{"authors":["Noémi Földes","Moritz Held","Tanja Stoll","Martin Baumann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1626998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626998400,"objectID":"00479524887a83a8ea0462790ea3e90e","permalink":"https://heldmoritz.github.io/archive/2021_iccm_2/","publishdate":"2021-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/archive/2021_iccm_2/","section":"archive","summary":"tba","tags":[],"title":"Hazard Perception in Dynamic Traffic Scenarios: A Java-ACT-R model","type":"archive"},{"authors":["Moritz Held","Jelmer Borst","Anirudh Unni","Jochem W.
