We present a multitasking model that performs a driving task in different driving conditions while performing a secondary working memory task. We developed two models\\ One that implements a central bottleneck at the central processing unit and a second model that additionally implements a bottleneck in the problem state of ACT-R. We compare the behavior of both models with human data in different driving and workload conditions. On top of different driving conditions, we show predictions of the model when working memory load is manipulated using a secondary task. By evaluating the behavior of the model, we conclude that a central bottleneck is insufficient when attempting to explain the interaction of cognitive load and driving difficulty. Instead, a bottleneck in the problem state can account for the differences in driving behavior between driving conditions and between working memory load levels.","tags":[],"title":"Multitasking while Driving: Central Bottleneck or Problem State Interference?","type":"archive"},{"authors":["Nóemi Földes","Moritz Held","Tanja Stoll","Martin Baumann"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Several theories assume that human drivers’ evaluation of the criticality of a dynamic traﬀic situation is mostly determined by the time-to-collision (TTC). We are developing a cognitive model using ACT-R to shed light on the complex cognitive processes that underlie situation awareness in a highly dynamic traﬀic scenario, in order to determine how participants evaluate the different conditions as critical or not. Our model aims to replicate empirical data from a video-study in which participants watched a potentially risky lane-change scenario and were instructed to rate how critical the situation was, and to select which action they would prefer to choose at the end of the scenario (i.e., accelerating, decelerating, maintaining speed; Stoll et al., 2018). The model observes the scenario and establishes a projection (about another road user’s position, trajectory, etc). As the driving scenario develops, the model checks whether the current projection is still valid, and in case it is not, a new memory retrieval takes place to adjust situation awareness. Importantly, according to our reasoning, drivers’ criticality evaluation is not a result of mere TTC perception, but of memory retrieval of past scenarios that help drivers to interpret the situation and make projections about its outcome. Moreover, we argue that other relevant road users and their situation (e.g., goal and intention) are taken into account during the criticality estimation process. With other words, we suggest that the driver’s situation awareness includes the representation of other road users’ situation awareness as well, to a certain extent.","tags":[],"title":"Challenges in modeling situation awareness and criticality estimation in driving based on a video-study: An ACT-R model","type":"archive"},{"authors":["Moritz Held","Jelmer Borst","Anirudh Unni","Jochem W.

Next to developments towards full automation, a separate field is making great contributions towards dynamically sharing the responsibilities between machine and human. For a successful implementation of this technology, a key step is to understand the cognitive processes in high workload situations while driving. For example, to reliably predict momentary cognitive workload and task interference. Following this line of research, cognitive models can greatly improve our understanding of the cognitive mechanisms relevant for complex driving scenarios. To this end, we have further developed a cognitive driving model in the cognitive architecture ACT-R. This model simulated behavior and brain data of a dataset in which working memory load and visuospatial demands were manipulated using a modified n-back task and alternating road conditions in a highway driving environment. In this talk, we will highlight the diﬀiculties that arise when specifying and parameterizing highly dynamic models and how we can use data from neuroimaging research as well as behavioral data to guide the model’s development. We discuss steps of optimizing this process and show how such driving models when properly calibrated can give insight into cognitive processes and how they can be used to make predictions about behavior and neurophysiology in driving related scenarios.","tags":[],"title":"Dealing with highly dynamic models: How behavioral and neuroimaging data can guide the modeling process in applied driving models","type":"archive"},{"authors":["Moritz Held"],"categories":null,"content":"You can expect my first blog post here, if I am not too shy to post it.\n","date":1638230400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638230400,"objectID":"de0e7df0f9c7425179d8c23b50ff4d36","permalink":"https://heldmoritz.github.io/blog/post1/","publishdate":"2021-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/post1/","section":"blog","summary":"You can expect my first blog post here, if I am not too shy to post it.","tags":["Academic, phdlife, rants"],"title":"My first year as a PhD student","type":"blog"},{"authors":["Noémi Földes","Moritz Held","Tanja Stoll","Martin Baumann"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Previous research found interactions between working memory load levels and visuospatial demands complicating the accurate prediction of momentary workload levels. To investigate this interaction further the cognitive concepts working memory load and visuospatial attention were integrated into a cognitive driving model using the cognitive architecture ACT-R. The model was developed to perform a modified n-back task using speed signs while maintaining a safe position on the road. Furthermore, it is able to safely overtake cars in everyday traffic on a multilane highway while continuously adjusting the speed of the car according to the n-back task. The behavioral results show a negative effect on driving performance with increasing task difficulty of the secondary task. Additionally, the model indicates an interaction at a common, task-unspecific level. This is the first step to a fully integrated driving model, which could provide further insight into the interaction between working memory load and visuospatial demand.","tags":[],"title":"XXUtilizing ACT-R to investigate interactions between working memory and visuospatial attention while driving","type":"archive"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
